How to use the files:
	Each section in the exercise is accessible by running the file name and the section letter (i.e. a , 	b , c â€¦), more parameters may be needed according to the section requirements.  

programing exercise 1
sec. A:	python2.7 ex2q1.py a [img no. to query] [no. of neighbors]
	output: prediction of the label of input image
sec. B:	python2.7 ex2q1.py c // LOOK AT K VALUE AT K=10
	output: Accuracy level of k=1,..,100 (Look at the value of k=10)
sec. C:	python2.7 ex2q1.py c
	output: returns the best k and plots the error rate on the test set for every k.
			file: plotQ1c.png
sec. D:	python2.7 ex2q1.py d [k value]
	output: best size of training data for a given k and plot a	graph of accuracy with increasing training data size.
			file: plotQ1d.png

programing exercise 2
sec. A:	python2.7 ex2q2.py a
	output: a plot of interval and 100 (x,y) values
			file: plotQ2a.png
sec. B:	python2.7 ex2q2.py b
	output: A list of intervals with their accuracy levels.
sec. C:	python2.7 ex2q2.py c
	output: plots a graph of the ERM error and the true error of the hypothesis.
			file: plotQ2c.png
sec. D:	python2.7 ex2q2.py d
	output: plot showing the ERM error and True error (the true error is not surprising	constant because 		the sample data is the same across all runs)
			file: plotQ2d.png
sec. E:	python2.7 ex2q2.py e
	output:	plots the average of 100 times for each k 
			file: plotQ2e.png
sec. F:	python2.7 ex2q2.py f
	output: plots the error of the hypothesis intervals on the cross validation set.
